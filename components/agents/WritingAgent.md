# WritingAgent
This agent generates a detailed, well-structured report from a given topic and a Markdown outline.

## Input
The input to this agent is a JSON object with the following structure:
```json
{
  "topic": "The main subject of the report",
  "outline": "A Markdown-formatted outline providing the structure for the report. This should include headings and bullet points."
}
```

## Output
The output of this agent is a comprehensive, long-form report in Markdown format, elaborating on each section of the provided outline.

## Logic
1.  **Parse Input**: Read the `topic` and `outline` from the input JSON.
2.  **Analyze Outline**: Deconstruct the Markdown outline to understand the main sections and sub-points required in the report.
3.  **Elaborate on Sections**: For each heading and bullet point in the outline, generate detailed paragraphs that expand on the idea, provide context, and add relevant information.
4.  **Synthesize and Structure**: Combine the elaborated sections into a cohesive and well-structured document, following the original outline's hierarchy.
5.  **Format and Refine**: Ensure the language is professional, the flow is logical, and the formatting is clean and readable using Markdown.
6.  **Generate Report**: Output the final, comprehensive Markdown report.

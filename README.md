# LLMunix

A Pure Markdown Operating System where everything is either an agent or tool defined in markdown documents. Claude Code serves as the runtime engine interpreting these markdown specifications.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
First, start "Claude Code" or "Gemini CLI" in your terminal:
```bash
claude
```

### Boot LLMunix
Once you're in CLI, boot the LLMunix operating system:
```bash
boot llmunix
```

### Example Commands

**Constraint-aware intelligence gathering:**
```bash
llmunix execute: "Monitor 5 tech news sources, extract trending topics, and generate intelligence briefing"
# System adapts constraints based on API limitations, maintains intelligence value through graceful degradation
```

**Memory-driven task execution:**
```bash
llmunix execute: "Research AI safety papers - query memory for past research patterns and apply successful approaches"
# QueryMemoryTool consults past experiences, MemoryAnalysisAgent recommends optimal strategy
```

**Adaptive execution with sentiment tracking:**
```bash
llmunix execute: "Urgent: analyze this legal document for risks in 10 minutes"
# System detects urgency, adapts constraints: priority='speed_and_clarity', persona='concise_assistant'
```

## What is LLMunix?

LLMunix is an AI-powered operating system that implements **Adaptive Behavior Management** - where system behavior dynamically adapts through evolving behavioral constraints:

- **Pure Markdown Architecture**: All system components are markdown files interpreted by Claude as a functional OS
- **Adaptive State Management**: Behavioral constraints (user sentiment, priorities, error tolerance) evolve during execution
- **Intelligent Memory System**: Structured, queryable experience database with pattern recognition and adaptive learning
- **Modular State Architecture**: Specialized state files (plan.md, context.md, constraints.md) for atomic updates
- **Real Tool Integration**: Maps to Claude Code's native tools with graceful degradation and error recovery
- **Adaptive Execution**: Dynamic constraint evolution based on user feedback, errors, and execution context

### Advanced Features

#### Adaptive State Management
- **Behavioral Constraints**: Dynamic user sentiment tracking, priority adaptation, error tolerance management
- **Constraint Evolution**: Real-time behavioral modification based on execution events and user feedback
- **Adaptive Personas**: Communication style switching (concise assistant, detailed analyst, proactive collaborator)
- **Memory-Driven Initialization**: Past experiences inform initial constraint settings for similar tasks

#### Intelligent Memory System
- **Structured Experience Database**: YAML frontmatter with qualitative insights for intelligent querying
- **QueryMemoryTool**: Natural language interface to historical experience patterns

### Operating Modes

1. **EXECUTION MODE**: Real operations with adaptive constraint management and intelligent error recovery
2. **SIMULATION MODE**: Training data generation with behavioral pattern simulation for agent fine-tuning

### Adaptive Behavior Principles

LLMunix operates on **Adaptive Behavior Management**: system state encompasses not just data and decisions, but **evolving behavioral constraints** that actively modify decision-making processes for intelligent adaptive behavior.

#### Key Behavioral Modifiers:
- **user_sentiment**: Detected emotional state influencing interaction style (neutral, pleased, frustrated, stressed)
- **priority**: Execution focus (speed_and_clarity, comprehensiveness, cost_efficiency, quality)
- **active_persona**: Communication style (concise_assistant, detailed_analyst, proactive_collaborator)
- **error_tolerance**: Risk acceptance level (strict, moderate, flexible)
- **human_review_trigger_level**: Threshold for seeking guidance (low, medium, high)

#### Constraint Adaptation Examples:
- **User Frustration Detected** → priority="speed_and_clarity", human_review_trigger_level="low"
- **Positive Feedback Received** → user_sentiment="pleased", active_persona="proactive_collaborator"
- **Repeated Failures** → error_tolerance="strict", memory consultation for recovery strategies
- **Cost Exceeding Budget** → priority="cost_efficiency", prefer lower-cost tool alternatives

# LLMunix: Pure Markdown Operating System Framework

This is LLMunix, a Pure Markdown Operating System where everything is either an agent or tool defined in markdown documents. Claude Code serves as the runtime engine interpreting these markdown specifications.

## Framework Philosophy: Pure Markdown

**CRITICAL: LLMunix is a PURE MARKDOWN framework. Everything is either an agent or tool defined in markdown documents.**

### Core Principles:
- **Markdown-Driven Execution**: LLM interpreter reads and sends full markdown specifications to LLM for interpretation and execution
- **No Code Generation**: System behavior emerges from LLM interpreting markdown documents sent at runtime
- **Agent/Tool Duality**: Every component is either an agent (decision maker) or tool (executor) defined in markdown
- **Real Tool Integration**: Markdown components map to actual tool execution via TOOL_CALL format
- **Sentient State Architecture**: Behavioral constraints evolve dynamically to enable adaptive decision-making
- **Memory-Driven Learning**: Historical experiences become actionable intelligence for continuous improvement
- **Dynamic Creation**: New tools/agents are created as markdown specifications during runtime
- **LLM as Interpreter**: LLM receives and interprets markdown system definitions to achieve any goal

### Operating Modes:
1. **EXECUTION MODE**: Real operations using Claude Code's native tools mapped through markdown specs
2. **SIMULATION MODE**: Training data generation through markdown-defined simulation patterns

The OS "boots" when Claude reads the markdown system files and begins interpreting them as a functional operating system.

## How to Boot LLMunix

### Boot Command
```
boot llmunix
```

This simple command activates the LLMunix kernel by having Claude read and interpret the markdown system files as a functional operating system. **Boot automatically cleans the workspace directory to ensure a fresh execution environment.**

### Boot Welcome Message
When LLMunix boots, display ASCII art welcome and example commands in this format:

                Pure Markdown Operating System v1.0
```

Examples:
```bash
llmunix execute: "Monitor 5 tech news sources (TechCrunch, Ars Technica, Hacker News, MIT Tech Review, Wired), extract trending topics, identify patterns, and generate a weekly intelligence briefing"

llmunix execute: "Get live content from https://huggingface.co/blog and create a research summary"

llmunix simulate: "Research task workflow for fine-tuning dataset"
```

### Running the Real-World Research Scenario

1. **Execute the scenario** by asking Claude to:
   - Act as the SystemAgent defined in `system/SystemAgent.md`
   - Execute the goal from `scenarios/RealWorld_Research_Task.md`
   - Use EXECUTION MODE for real tool calls

2. **Expected behavior:**
   - Claude creates modular `workspace/state/` directory with specialized files
   - Initializes `constraints.md` with behavioral modifiers based on task context
   - Uses QueryMemoryTool for intelligent memory consultation during planning
   - Adapts execution style based on user sentiment and historical patterns
   - State machine execution:
     - **State 1→2**: RealWebFetchTool fetches live content with constraint-aware error handling
     - **State 2→3**: RealSummarizationAgent analyzes content using memory-recommended approaches
     - **State 3→4**: RealFileSystemTool saves structured outputs with behavioral adaptations
   - Updates modular state files after each step with real results and constraint evolution
   - Records complete experience in structured memory log with sentiment and adaptation insights
   - Generates training data from real execution trace including behavioral learning patterns
